Authentication Mechanism
The authentication mechanism begins with user registration, where users provide necessary credentials such as email and password. Passwords are securely stored using hashing algorithms like bcrypt, ensuring they remain unreadable even if the database is compromised. Upon login, the system validates the credentials and issues a JSON Web Token (JWT). The JWT is signed and encoded with a secret key, acting as a secure session token for authenticated users.

For enhanced security, token expiration and refresh mechanisms are implemented to mitigate risks associated with token theft. OAuth can also be integrated to allow users to authenticate via trusted third-party providers such as Google or Facebook.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC is designed to determine user permissions based on their assigned roles. Upon user registration or assignment by an admin, a specific role is associated with each user. Admins have the highest privileges, such as managing users and resources, while Moderators may handle specific content moderation tasks, and Users have basic access rights.

Access to API endpoints and resources is secured through middleware that checks the userâ€™s role and permissions encoded within their JWT. For example:

Admin Role: Full access to create, read, update, and delete any resource.
Moderator Role: Limited access to moderate specific content.
User Role: Access to personal data and general user functionalities.
Secure Session Management
JWT ensures stateless and scalable session management, allowing distributed systems to authenticate users without relying on server-side session storage. HTTPS and secure headers are enforced to prevent common attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

By combining secure authentication methods with RBAC, this system ensures a robust and user-friendly approach to managing resources and protecting sensitive data.
